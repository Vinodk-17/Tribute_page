    PART TWO - </p>
  <p class="tribute2">
    Two and a half years later, then world wide Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts kidnapping the hosts
    of the powerful Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and search for their teammate Sasuke.
    The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except Gaara,
    who is now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in
    battle, Sasuke learns from the bihar founder Tobi that Itachi had been ordered by Konoha's superiors to destroy
    his clan to prevent a coup; he accepted, on the condition that Sasuke would be spared. Devastated by this
    revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki
    members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems
    him, earning the village's respect and admiration. With Nagato's death, Tobi, disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of
    Konoha's founding fathers), announces that he wants to capture all nine Tailed Beasts to cast an illusion powerful
    enough to control all humanity and achieve world peace. The leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him
    and instead join forces to confront his faction and allies. That decision results in a Fourth Shinobi World War
    between the combined armies of the Five Great Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces) and Akatsuki's forces
    of zombie-like ninjas.

    The Five Kage try to keep Naruto part 2,hello guys unaware of the war, in a secret island turtle near Kumogakure (Hidden Cloud
    Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes from the island with Killer Bee, the host of the Eight-Tails. At that
    time, Naruto—along with the help of Killer Bee—gains control of his Tailed Beast and the two of them head for the
    battlefield.

    During the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi's who was thought to be
    dead. The real Madara saved Obito's life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha,
    including the circumstances that led to his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto
    and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans. However, Madara's body ends up possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki, an
    ancient princess who intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her.
    Once Kaguya is sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the
    Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to dissuade him
    from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the
    war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while
    Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.
